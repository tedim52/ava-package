ðŸ”º Avalanche Package
============
This is a [Kurtosis](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis/) package for spinning up a local configurable Avalanche network. 

Run this package
----------------
If you have [Kurtosis installed][install-kurtosis], clone this repo locally and run: 

```bash
kurtosis run . --enclave avalanche --args-file configs/one-chain.json
```

Once this repo is public users will also be able to run `kurtosis run github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-package` so they don't have to clone the repo.

You can find other configurations under the `config` folder.

To remove the created [enclave][enclaves-reference], run `kurtosis enclave rm avalanche -f`.

## ðŸš€ Codespace

Create a new Codespace from this repository using the button below. The default settings for the Codespace will work just fine.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=master&repo=864218549&skip_quickstart=true&machine=standardLinux32gb&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdevcontainer.json)

Once the codespace is set up, run `chmod 777 ./scripts/setup-codespace.sh` followed by `./scripts/setup-codespace.sh` This will simply check that Docker is running and install Kurtosis. Then you will be able to run Kurtosis commands.

#### Configuration

You can configure this package using the JSON structure below. The default values for each parameter are shown.

```javascript
{
    // add more dicts to spin up more L1s
    "chain-configs": [
        {
            // the name of the blockchain you want to have
            "name": "myblockchain",

            // the vm you want to use to start the chain
            // currently the support options are subnetevm and morpheusvm
            // the default is subnetevm
            "vm": "subnetevm",

            // the network id for you chain
            "network-id": 555555,

            "enable-teleporter": true,

            "erc20-bridge-config": {
                // name of token you want to enable bridging for, by default every subnetevm chain spun up by the package automatically deploys a token contract with the name TOK
                "token-name": "TOK",

                // the chain you want to enable bridging to
                // must be the name of another chain within this config file
                "destinations": ["mysecondblockchain"]
            }

            "enable-teleporter": true
        }
    ],
    // number of nodes to start on the network
    "num-nodes": 3,

    "node-cfg": {
        // network id that nodes use to know where to connect, by default this is 1337 - which indicates a local avalanche network
        "network-id": "1337",
        "staking-enabled": false,
        "health-check-frequency": "5s"
    },
    
    // if you are running inside a codespace, provide this configuration with the value of `echo $CODESPACE_NAME`. 
    // this is needed to make sure that networking for additional services like the blockscout explorer are proxied to the codepsace correctly
    "codespace": "verbose-couscous-q45vq44g552657q",
    
    // a list of additional infrastructure services you can have the package spin up in the encalve
    "additional-services": {
        // starts prometheus + grafana instance connected to one node on the network
        // provides dashboards for monitoring the Avalanche node - including metrics on all primary network and configured chains, resource usage, etc
        "observability": true,

        // creates a tx spammer that spams transactions - note this only works for a subnetevm chain
        // one spammer is created for each subnetevm chain spun up in the package
        "tx-spammer": true,

        // spins up the interchain token transfer frontend, a UI that allows you to bridge ERC 20 tokens from one chain to another
        // note this only works for configs that deploy an erc20 token bridge and have at minimum to chains
        "ictt-frontend": true,

        // spins up a faucet configured for every chain spun up in the package
        "faucet": true,


        // spins up a blockscout explorer for each chain
        "block-explorer": true
    },

    // cpu arch of machine this package runs on 
    // this is only required when spinning up non subnetevm chains, defaults to arm64
    "cpu-arch": "arm64"
}
```
